### In this SQL, I'm querying a database (BIT_DB) with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5

--QUESTION 1 (How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID' ;


--QUESTION 2 (How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT orderID) 
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND JanSales.Product = 'iPhone' ;



--QUESTION 3 (Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February)
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN FebSales ON customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID' ;



--QUESTION 4 (Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales) ; 
-- OR
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;



--QUESTION 5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
--(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT DISTINCT Product,SUM(Quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM JanSales 
WHERE orderID <> 'order ID' AND length(OrderID) = 6
GROUP BY Product;



--Question 6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
  SELECT Product,SUM( Quantity), SUM(Quantity * price) AS revenue
  FROM FebSales WHERE location  like '%548 Lincoln%'
  AND orderID <> 'orderID'
  AND Length(orderID) = 6
  GROUP BY Product;
  
--Question 7 --How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (*) AS num_of_cus,
avg(amnt_spent)
FROM (
    SELECT SUM(price * Quantity) AS amnt_spent
    FROM FebSales 
   WHERE orderID <> 'orderID'
    AND LENGTH( orderID)=6
    GROUP BY orderID 
    HAVING SUM(Quantity) > 2 );


-- QUESTION 8  List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
  SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity) AS amount_sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
